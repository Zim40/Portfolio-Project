# Portfolio Project

## About
This Portfolio Project is designed to showcase current and upcoming projects to potential employers and other developers.

## Usage

This Portfolio will be used to showcase my growing talent and knowledge as a fullstack developer. 

## Future Additions
As time goes by and I refine the skills I have learnt during bootcamp, I will add to this Portfolio, not just the content that is included but also the design, eventually transforming the basic shell as it is now into a beautiful culmination of the work I have put into becoming a Web Developer.
