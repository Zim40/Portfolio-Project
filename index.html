                    <p>Welcome to my Portfolio, my name is Michael Monaghan and it is my pleasure to show you the work i have created. I have a background in labour jobs but have always had a knack for the complicated and intricate way in the internet works. Leading from that curiousity I find myself delving into the broad ocean that is Web development and here I have collected the acheivments I am most pround of.<br>Enjoy!</p>

                <p>I have worked on many projects that i am proud of but some stand out more than others. Simple and creative are the foundations of creating an engaging and interactive user experience, but that does not come without a price sometimes. This is why my stand out project of recent weeks has been the Horiseon Code Refactor which you can find on my Github page or through the link connected to the display card.</p>
