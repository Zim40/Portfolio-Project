                        <p>Welcome! My name is Michael Monaghan and this is my humble Portfolio. At the young age of thirty, I decided to drop all tools and take up a new adventure. With this new found drive and passion for pushing my own boundaries and excelling<br> in something other than manual labour jobs, I found myself on the steps of Web Development.<br>
                        As I learn and grow in this ever changing environment i hope to add to this Portfolio the many great achievements i accomplish.<br>
                        Take a look around, if you have any questions please feel free to reach out and connect. Thank you</p>
